            <P>Ahoy! Welcome aboard. I'm your Captian Kenny, Kenny Loggins that is. Are your ready to set sail on the Yacht that 
            I call my life? I'll do my best to avoid the "dangerzone" but I do like to keep things "footloose" if you catch my drift.
            </P>
        <h2>Growing up</h2>
    
            <img src="early.jpg" alt="Early Life" width="150" height="175"/>
           
            <p>I was born January 7th, 1948 to my parents, Robert and Lina. I was the youngest of three brothers. We moved around 
            a lot as I grew up. Eventually we landed in California where it felt I was always mean't to be. The beach, ocean, sailing 
            and sand would always influence my music, hence the term Yacht Rock. Speaking of music, I've always loved it. I started 
            forming bands as soon as I was out of highschool.

                <p> Yacht Rock refers to music that was released between the early 1970s through the early 1980s. It was usually written, 
                    recorded or produced in Califronia. The songs that define this genre tend to have an easy going or party vibe. They 
                    often invoke images of the beach, sun, sand, love and hanging with friends. Musicians who define this genre are 
                    Kenny Loggines, Michael McDonald, The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan, and Boz Scaggs. The term Yacht Rock did not
                    become a part of popular culture until the early 2000s when this music saw a resurgence in popularity. The 
                    generation that grew up with this music started to become empty-nesters and started to reclaim parts of their youth.

        <h2>Early Music career</h2>
           
            <img src="LM.jfif" alt="Loggins and Messina" width="150" height="175"/>
            
            <P> I was first successful writting a few songs for the Nitty Gritty Dirt band in the early 70's. This lead to me 
            getting a record deal with ABC music.  It was at ABC music that I met Jim Messina. He was just supposed to help me learn 
            the lay of the land in the music industry, but we sounded so good together we ended up forming the duo Loggins and Messina. 
            We had a lot of success together, selling <strong>16 million records!</strong> We were actually the most successful duo of 
            the Seventies until Hall and Oates surpassed us...talk about Man-eaters.
            </P>
        
        <h2>Sailing Solo</h2>
           
            <img src="The Captains.jfif" alt="Kenny and Michael at The Grammies" width="150" height="175"/>
              
            <P> Messina and I split up in the mid-Seventies and I struck out on my own. I released three very successful albums 
            between 1977 and 1982. On which I got to duet with famous singers like Stevie Nicks, Steve Perry and my good buddy Michael 
            McDonald. Michael and I would go on to write several songs together that were pretty big hits and even won us some awards.
            You ever heard of a Grammy? But it was the next evolution of my musical journey where things really took off.
            </P>
        
        <h2>King of the Movie Soundtracks</h2>

            <img src="Dangerzone.jfif" alt="Top Gun" width="150" height="175"/>

            <p>So while most people call me Captain, for awhile I was also known as the King of the soundtrack. During the 1980's, 
            I wrote hit songs for movies like "CaddyShack," "Caddyshack II," "Footloose," and "Top Gun." You couldn't go to a middle
            school dance back then and not hear my voice.
            </p>

        <h2>Sailing into the Horizon</h2>
            <img src="Alive.jfif" alt="On Tour" width="150" height="175"/>
            <p> Since then I have been taking it pretty easy. I've released some more solo albums through the years, 
                including a couple of children's albums. I also formed the country music trio Blue Sky Riders. I have toured 
                all around the world and continue to tour to this day. I've also had the opportunity to guest star in several tv shows 
               (live action and animated), usually playing a version of myself. I even lent my voice to the video 
               game <i style="color: blue">Grand Theft Auto V</i> playing a radio DJ by the name of none other than 
               <b>Captain Loggins</b>. I've been married a couple of times, but am currently single and
               I have 5 children. I still live in California, residing in Sunny Santa Barbara for the past couple of decades. 
            </p>
            <p> And would you look at that! It appears the sun is setting and were almost back to port. I hope you've enjoyed the ride. 
               I know I have. Hope to see you at one of my shows or back on the open seas sometime soon. 
            </p>
